# Wish by Nana

Fashion is an essential part of our daily lives, yet the task of shopping for clothes remain a time-consuming ordeal. 

Have you ever seen someone wearing something really chic and trendy then immediately wonder where he/she bought it from? Have you received a dress code for a party and wished you knew exactly where to buy such item(s), and how much they would cost? For those working in fashion retail, ever wanted to show a shirt to the computer screen and get back all available information for that SKU, without having to type anything into the system? 

I created WISH from scratch because I want to offer a proof-of-concept solution to abovementioned problems faced by both Shops and Shoppers. WISH is the result of my 12 weeks in a Machine Learning Bootcamp taught at CoderSchool in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The project competed with 16 others and snatched the **First Prize** agreed upon by 5 external judges. Find out more here. 

**WISH** is a machine-learning powered fashion recommendation engine which allow users to input any JPG or JPEG photo of clothing items and receive recommendations for visually similar items (and where to buy them). It works using **Object Detection** with **YOLO V3**, **Feature Extraction** with **Inception V3** in conjunction with **K-Nearest Neighbor**.
