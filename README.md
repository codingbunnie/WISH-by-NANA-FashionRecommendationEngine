# Wish by Nana

**WISH** is a machine-learning powered fashion recommendation engine which allow users to input any JPG or JPEG photo of clothing items and receive recommendations for visually similar items (and where to buy them). It works using **Object Detection** with **YOLO V3**, **Feature Extraction** with **Inception V3** in conjunction with **K-Nearest Neighbor**. 

Proposed Applications: 

- SHOPS: Instant Item Retrieval 
- SHOPPERS: Instant Shop-the-Look Solution

I created WISH from scratch because I wanted to offer a proof-of-concept solution to specific-item retrieval faced by both Shops and Shoppers. WISH is the result of my 12 weeks in a Machine Learning Bootcamp taught at CoderSchool in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The project competed with 16 others and snatched the **First Prize** agreed upon by 5 external judges. Find out more here.
